<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>WHITEFIELD AND KENNINGTON COMMON.</h3>

  <p>Your correspondent the <span class="sc">Rev. W. Sparrow Simpson</span>
  (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;295.) has given some interesting little notes respecting
  the past history of Kennington Common. Other notes might be added, and
  which should not be overlooked in a record of events connected with a
  spot whose associations and whose name are about to pass away for ever.
  After all, it is a righteous act, a noble deed, a benevolent mission,
  that gives a kind of immortality to a locality. It was here that the ever
  memorable George Whitefield proclaimed in an earnest voice, and with an
  earnest look, the gospel of Jesus Christ to multitudes of his
  fellow-creatures. He was wonderfully endowed by God for his great work,
  and the evidence of his vast success is to be found in the fact that
  immense numbers flocked from all parts to listen to the tidings which he
  had to deliver. He had audiences on Kennington Common amounting to ten,
  twenty and thirty thousand people, great numbers of whom were savingly
  impressed by his message. He melted their hearts, and sent them away,
  reflecting on the great problems of man's history, and on the dignity and
  destiny of the human mind. Take the following from his published diary,
  which is now scarce, and not much known:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sunday, April 29, 1731. At five in the evening went and preached at
  Kennington Common, about two miles from London, where upwards of 20,000
  people were supposed to be present. The wind being for me, it carried the
  voice to the extremest part of the audience. All stood attentive, and
  joined in the Psalm and Lord's Prayer so regularly, that I scarce ever
  preached with more quietness in any church. Many were much affected."</p>

  <p>"Sunday, May 6, 1731. At six in the evening preached at Kennington;
  but such a sight I never saw before. Some supposed there were above
  30,000 or 40,000 people, and near fourscore coaches, besides great
  numbers of horses; and there was such an awful silence amongst them, and
  the Word of God came with such power, that all seemed pleasingly
  surprised. I continued my discourse for an hour and a half."</p>

  <p>"Sunday, July 22, 1739. Went to St. Paul's and received the blessed
  Sacrament, and preached in the evening at Kennington Common to about
  30,000 hearers. God gave me great power."</p>

  <p>"Friday, August 3, 1739. Having spent the day in completing my affairs
  (about to embark for America), and taking leave of my dear friends, I
  preached in the evening to near 20,000 at Kennington Common. I chose to
  discourse on St. Paul's parting speech to the elders at Ephesus, at which
  the people were exceedingly affected, and almost prevented my making any
  application. Many tears were shed when I talked of leaving them. I
  concluded all with a suitable hymn, but could scarce get to the coach for
  the people thronging me, to take me by the hand, and give me a parting
  blessing."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Let those who have a deep sympathy with the great and good, who have
  served their age with exalted devotion and burning zeal, remember that on
  that very spot which is now called Kennington Park, this extraordinary
  man lifted up his powerful voice, and with commanding attitude, with the
  tenderest affection, with persuasive tones, and with thrilling appeals,
  proclaimed the "glorious gospel of the blessed God" to multitudes of the
  human family. He preached as in the light, and on the borders of the
  eternal world. It is such facts as these that will enhance in mind and
  memory the interest of such a spot. The philosophy of Whitefield's life
  has yet to be written.</p>

<h3>ANACHRONISMS.</h3>

  <p>Mr. Thackeray makes another trip in the present (April) number of
  <i>The Newcomes</i>. Clive writes a letter dated "May 1, 183&mdash;,"
  which is at once answered by Pendennis, who sends him "an extract from
  Bagham's article on the Royal Academy," and Mr. Thackeray makes the
  critic ask, "Why have we no picture of the <i>sovereign and her august
  consort</i> from Smee's brush?" To which it may be answered, "Because,
  even if the '183&mdash;' represents the time of Victoria's reign, her
  Majesty did not take unto herself an 'august consort' until Feb. 10,
  1840." It may also be observed, that in all the illustrations to Mr.
  Thackeray's delightful story, Mr. Doyle has clothed the <i>dramatis
  personæ</i> in the dresses of the present day. A notable example of this
  occurs at p.&nbsp;75., in his clever sketch of Mrs. Newcome's At Home, "a
  small early party" given in the year 1833, the date being determined by a
  very simple act of mental arithmetic, since the author informs us that
  the colonel went to the party in the mufti-coat "sent him out by Messrs.
  Stultz to India in the year 1821," and which he had "been in the habit of
  considering a splendid coat for twelve years past." The anachronism on
  Mr. Doyle's part is probably intentional. Indeed, he only follows the
  example which Mr. Thackeray had justified in these words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was the author's intention, faithful to history, to depict all the
  characters of this tale in their proper costumes, as they wore them at
  the commencement of the century. But, when I remember the appearance of
  people in those days, and that an officer and lady were actually habited
  like this [here follows one of Mr. Thackeray's graphic sketches], I have
  not the heart to disfigure my heroes and heroines by costumes so hideous;
  and have, on the contrary, engaged a <!-- Page 368 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page368"></a>{368}</span>model of rank dressed
  according to the present fashion."&mdash;<i>Vanity Fair</i>, note to
  p.&nbsp;55.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And, certainly, when one looks at a fashion-book published some twenty
  years ago, one cannot feel surprised at Mr. Doyle, or any other man of
  taste, preferring to commit an anachronism, rather than depict frights
  and monstrosities.</p>

  in the suggestion of an original solution on Matt. xvi. 16-19. I submit
  it (not presumptuously, but hopefully), that its examination and
  discussion, by your learned readers, may throw more light upon my humble
  endeavour to elucidate a passage which seems to have been darkened "by a
  multitude of words."</p>

  <p>The solution I propose is an extract from my MS. annotations on the
  Hebrew Old Testament, and forms a portion of a note on Habakkuk ii. 11.
  It will be desirable, for the readier comprehension of my exposition, to
  give the original, with a literal translation, of the verse alluded
  to:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6"><span lang="he" class="heb" title="KY 'BN MQYR TZ`Q" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5D9; &#x5D0;&#x5D1;&#x5DF; &#x5DE;&#x5E7;&#x5D9;&#x5E8; &#x5EA;&#x5D6;&#x5E2;&#x5E7;</bdo></span>&#x200E;</p>
      <p class="i6"><span lang="he" class="heb" title="WKPYS M`TS Y`NNH:" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D5;&#x5DB;&#x5E4;&#x5D9;&#x5E1; &#x5DE;&#x5E2;&#x5E5; &#x5D9;&#x5E2;&#x5E0;&#x5E0;&#x5D4;&#x5C3;</bdo></span>&#x200E;</p>
      <p class="hg3">"For the [<i>Ebhen</i>] stone shall cry out of the wall,</p>
      <p>And the [<i>Caphis</i>] fastening shall testify out of the timber."<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This verse has passed into a proverb amongst the Jews in every part of
  the world. It is invariably quoted to express the impossibility of
  secrecy or concealment; or to intimate the inevitable publicity of a
  certain fact. In short, the proverb implies the same meaning which our
  Lord's answer to the Pharisees expressed, viz., "If these should hold
  their peace, the stones would immediately cry out" (Luke xix. 40.). I
  have myself heard the words under note used as a proverb, in this manner,
  amongst the Jews of Europe, Asia, and Africa. I am, moreover, inclined to
  believe that it was already one of the national proverbs in the days of
  our Lord.</p>

  <p>All this may appear irrelevant to the critical exposition of this
  verse; but the consideration may help to clear up an apparently obscure
  passage in the New Testament, namely, Matt. xvi. 16-19. When Simon made
  the declaration in verse 16., "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
  God," he might have thought of or expressed the inspired proverb:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6"><span lang="he" class="heb" title="KY 'BN MQYR TZ`Q" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5D9; &#x5D0;&#x5D1;&#x5DF; &#x5DE;&#x5E7;&#x5D9;&#x5E8; &#x5EA;&#x5D6;&#x5E2;&#x5E7;</bdo></span>&#x200E;</p>
      <p class="i6"><span lang="he" class="heb" title="WKPYS M`TS Y`NNH:" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D5;&#x5DB;&#x5E4;&#x5D9;&#x5E1; &#x5DE;&#x5E2;&#x5E5; &#x5D9;&#x5E2;&#x5E0;&#x5E0;&#x5D4;&#x5C3;</bdo></span>&#x200E;</p>
      <p class="hg3">"For the [<i>Ebhen</i>] stone shall cry out of the wall,</p>
      <p>And the [<i>Caphis</i>] fastening shall testify out of the timber."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Thinking, or expressing, that concealment of the Messiahship of Jesus
  was impracticable.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And Jesus [to whom word, thought, and deed were alike patent]
  answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; for flesh
  and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in
  heaven. And I say also unto thee, That thou art <i>Caphis</i>; and upon
  the <i>Ebhen</i> I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not
  prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
  heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt <i>bind</i> on earth, shall be
  <i>bound</i> in heaven," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The play (if so common an expression might be used in so sacred a
  theme) is not on the word <i>Peter</i>, but on the word <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="KPYS" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5E4;&#x5D9;&#x5E1;</bdo></span>&#x200E;
  (<i>Caphis</i>), which signifies a rafter, a cross beam, a <i>binder</i>;
  or, as the margin (on Habak. ii. 11.) has it, "a fastener," from the verb
  <span lang="he" class="heb" title="KPS" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5E4;&#x5E1;</bdo></span>&#x200E; (<i>Caphas</i>), to
  <i>bind</i>, to connect, to join.</p>

  <p>That our Lord never used the Greek word <span title="su ei Petros" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&#x1F7A; &epsilon;&#x1F36;
  &Pi;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> all must admit; that
  <span title="Kêphas" class="grk">&Kappa;&eta;&phi;&#x1FB6;&sigmaf;</span>
  is not the Syriac word for stone is well known to every Oriental scholar.
  The proper Syriac word for stone is <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="K'P'" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DB;&#x5D0;&#x5E4;&#x5D0;</bdo></span>&#x200E;. However,
  there is a resemblance between the respective words, which may have been
  the origin of Simon's second surname&mdash;I mean to that of
  Cephas&mdash;Peter.</p>

  <p>The import of Matt. xvi. 16-19. seems to me to be this: Christ
  acknowledges Simon to be part and parcel of the house, the Church; nay,
  more, He tells Simon that He intends him to be a "master-builder," to
  join, or bind, many members to that Church, all of which would be owned
  of Him. But the Church itself must be built upon the <i>Ebhen</i>, the
  <i>Stone</i>; by which Jesus evidently alluded to Ps. cxviii. 22.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4"><span lang="he" class="heb" title="'BN M'SW HBWNYM" ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5D0;&#x5D1;&#x5DF; &#x5DE;&#x5D0;&#x5E1;&#x5D5; &#x5D4;&#x5D1;&#x5D5;&#x5E0;&#x5D9;&#x5DD;</bdo></span>&#x200E;</p>

      <p class="hg3">"The <i>Ebhen</i> which the builders refused</p>
      <p>Is become the head stone of the corner."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>(Compare Matt. xxi. 42.)</p>

  <p>May I ask whether the words <span title="ho ermêneutai Petros" class="grk"
  >&#x1F45; &epsilon;&rho;&mu;&eta;&nu;&epsilon;&#x1F7B;&tau;&alpha;&iota;
  &Pi;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> are to be considered as
  the words of St. John, or of his transcribers? The question may appear
  startling to some, but my copy of the Syriac New Testament is
  <i>minus</i> that sentence.</p>

  <p>I send you this copy from a <i>nibbing</i> of a quaint epitaph, made
  in the beautiful old church of Lavenham many years since, with a view to
  putting a Query as to its construction. The first two lines, as I read
  them, want a verb, unless we read the conclusion of the first line as a
  verb, to <i>in-brasse</i> (<i>i.e.</i> to record in brass). Can any of
  your readers give me an authority, from an old author, for the use of
  this or any similar verb? To <i>in-grain</i> seems somewhat like it, but
  is modern. If no authority for such a verb can be given, I should be glad
  to have the construction of the lines explained.</p>

  <p>I return you many thanks for your two letters of y<sup>e</sup> 10th
  and 11th inst., and for the trouble you are so obliging as to take on
  y<sup>e</sup> business of the Examiner's Office. I have found a copy of
  an appointment of an Examiner transmitted to me by Lodge in the year
  1762, and I send you Mr. Meredith's appointment upon the stamp'd paper
  you inclosed to me. If that appointment will not answer, or if the stamp
  is not a proper one, as you seem to hint may be the case, I must desire
  you to tell Mr. Perry to make out a proper appointment and send it over
  ready for my signature. I shou'd hope the one I send herewith will
  answer, that you may have no further trouble. I perceive five hundred
  pounds English was y<sup>e</sup> sum I receiv'd in 1762; and I imagine
  that is the sum Mr. Meredith proposes to give now, and to which I give my
  consent.</p>

  <p>I thank you for inquiring after my health; my fits of the gout are not
  very violent, but I am very glad you never have any of them. Pray make my

<h3>THE WANDERING BEE.</h3>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"High mountains closed the vale,</p>
      <p>Bare, rocky mountains, to all living things</p>
      <p>Inhospitable; on whose sides no herb</p>
      <p>Rooted, no insect fed, no bird awoke</p>
      <p>Their echoes, save the eagle, strong of wing;</p>
      <p class="i1">A lonely plunderer, that afar</p>
      <p class="i1">Sought in the vales his prey.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thither towards those mountains Thalaba</p>
      <p>Advanced, for well he ween'd that there had Fate</p>
      <p>Destined the adventure's end.</p>
      <p>Up a wide vale, winding amid their depths,</p>
      <p>A stony vale between receding heights</p>
      <p>Of stone, he wound his way.</p>
      <p>A cheerless place! <i>The solitary Bee,</i></p>
      <p><i>Whose buzzing was the only sound of life,</i></p>
      <p><i>Flew there on restless wing,</i></p>
      <p><i>Seeking in vain one blossom, where to fix.</i>"</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Thalaba</i>, book vi. 12, 13.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This incident of the wandering bee, highly poetical, seems at first
  sight very improbable, and passes for one of the many strange creations
  of this wild poem. But yet it is quite true to nature, and was probably
  suggested to Southey, an omnivorous reader, by some out-of-the-way book
  of travels.</p>

  <p>In Hurton's <i>Voyage to Lapland</i>, vol. ii. p.&nbsp;251., published a
  few years since, he says that as he stood on the verge of the North
  Cape,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The only living creature that came near me was a <i>bee</i>, which
  hummed merrily by. What did the busy insect seek there? Not a blade of
  grass grew, and the only vegetable matter on this point was a cluster of
  withered moss at the very edge of the awful precipice, and it I gathered
  at considerable risk as a memorial of my visit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So in Fremont's <i>Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains</i>,
  1842, p.&nbsp;69., he speaks of standing on the crest of the snow peak, 13,570
  feet above the Gulf of Mexico, and adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"During our morning's ascent, we had met no sign of animal life,
  except the small sparrow-like bird already mentioned. A stillness the
  most profound, and a terrible solitude, forced themselves constantly on
  the mind as the great features of the place. Here on the summit, where
  the stillness was absolute, unbroken by any sound, and the solitude
  complete, we thought ourselves beyond the region of animated life: but
  while we were sitting on the rock, a <i>solitary bee</i> (<i>Bromus</i>,
  the humble bee) came winging his flight from the eastern valley, and lit
  on the knee of one of the men.</p>

  <p>"It was a strange place, the icy rock and the highest peak of the
  Rocky Mountains, for a lover of warm sunshine and flowers; and we pleased
  ourselves with the idea that he was the first of his species to cross the
  mountain barrier, a solitary pioneer to foretell the advance of
  civilisation. I believe that a moment's thought would have made us let
  him continue his way unharmed, but we carried out the law of this
  country, where all animated nature seems at war; and seizing him
  immediately, put him in at least a fit place, in the leaves of a large
  book, among the flowers we had collected on our way."</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Tippet.</i>&mdash;The origin of words signifying articles of dress
  would be a curious subject for investigation. Tippet is derived by
  Barclay from the Saxon <i>tæppet</i>; but I find the following passage in
  Captain Erskine's Journal of his recent <i>Cruise in the Western
  Pacific</i>, p.&nbsp;36. He is writing of the dress of the women at the
  village of Feleasan, in the Samoan Islands:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And occasionally a garment (<i>tiputa</i>) resembling a small poncho,
  with a slit for the head, hanging so as decently to conceal the
  bosom."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>May we not trace here both the article and the name?</p>

  <p class="author">W. T. M.</p>

  <p><i>Ridings and Chaffings.</i>&mdash;A singular custom prevails in
  South Nottinghamshire and North Leicestershire. When a husband,
  forgetting his solemn vow to love, honour, and keep his wife, has had
  recourse to physical force and beaten her, the rustics get up what is
  called "a riding." A cart is drawn through the village, having in it two
  persons dressed so as to resemble the woman and her master. A dialogue,
  representing the quarrel, is carried on, and a supposed representation of
  the beating is inflicted. This performance is <!-- Page 371 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page371"></a>{371}</span>always specially
  enacted before the offender's door.</p>

  <p>Another, and perhaps less objectionable, mode of shaming men out of a
  brutal and an unmanly practice, is to empty a sack of chaff at the
  offender's door,&mdash;an intimation, I suppose, that <i>thrashing</i>
  has been "done within." Perhaps this latter custom gave rise to the term
  "chaffing." Thirty years ago both these customs were very common in this
  locality; but, either from an improved tone of morality, or from the
  comparative rarity of the offence that led to them, both <i>ridings</i>
  and <i>chaffings</i> are now of very rare occurrence.</p>

  <p>Can any reader of "N. &amp; Q." inform me whether these customs have
  prevailed, or still prevail, in other counties?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Thomas R. Potter.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Wymeswold, Leicestershire.</p>

  <p><i>Henry of Huntingdon's "Letter to Walter."</i>&mdash;Mr. Forester
  (Bohn's <i>Antiquarian Library</i>) decides, in opposition to Wharton and
  Hardy, that this epistle was written in 1135, during the lifetime of
  Henry I., and there can be no doubt that the passage he quotes bears him
  out in this; but it is not less certain that, whether owing to the death
  of the friend to whom the letter was addressed, or from a wholesome fear
  of the resentment of that king who is so roughly handled in it, the
  publication was deferred long enough for the author to reinforce by a few
  "modern instances" of more recent date, the "wise saws" which are so
  plentifully diffused through it: for instance, at p. 313. he mentions the
  death of Louis VI. of France, which occurred 1st August, 1137, twenty
  months after the death of Henry. And it is probable that a closer search
  than I have the means of making, would reveal other instances of a like
  nature, though this is sufficient by itself.</p>

  <p>After all, is it not possible that the worthy archdeacon (like
  Bolingbroke at a future day) may have antedated his letter to give
  himself an air of boldness and independence beyond what he really
  possessed? This would account not only for the references to later
  occurrences, but for the accurate fulfilment of the prophecy which he
  quotes about the duration of the reign of Henry I.</p>

  <p><i>Encyclopedia of Indexes, or Tables of Contents.</i>&mdash;I should
  like your opinion, and that of the readers of "N. &amp; Q.," as to the
  desirableness and practicability of forming a collection of the indexes
  of those books most commonly required to be referred to by authors and
  scholars. In reading up on any subject, when it is wished to know whether
  any author treats upon it, mainly or incidentally, his works must be
  examined at a great expense of time and labour. Perhaps some of your
  learned readers will express their views as to the value of such a
  thesaurus, and give suggestions as to the principles which ought to
  regulate its execution.</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>

<h3>GENESIS IV. 7.</h3>

  <p>Can any of your learned Hebraists elucidate the passage in Gen. iv.
  7., which called forth the following remarks from Bishop Sandford?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As yet I cannot abandon the literal interpretation of the words <span
  lang="he" class="heb" title="LAPETACH CHAT`A'T ROBEITS" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5DC;&#x5B7;&#x5E4;&#x5B6;&#x5EA;&#x5B7;&#x5D7;
  &#x5D7;&#x5B7;&#x5D8;&#x5B8;&#x5D0;&#x5EA;
  &#x5E8;&#x5B9;&#x5D1;&#x5B5;&#x5E5;</bdo></span>&#x200E;, and I am much
  surprised that, in all the criticism bestowed on this verse by Davison
  and the authors whom he quotes, nothing is said of the word <span
  lang="he" class="heb" title="PETACH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E4;&#x5B6;&#x5EA;&#x5B7;&#x5D7;</bdo></span>&#x200E;. I do
  not know of any place in Holy Scripture where this word is used
  figuratively, and unless this can be shown, there is no supporting so
  strong a metaphor as the advocates of the figurative meaning of the
  passage contend for. Davison takes no notice of the remainder of the
  verse.... Now the words are remarkable; they are the same as those in
  which the Lord declares the subjection of Eve to her husband, Gen. iii.
  16. I have always thought this passage (Gen. iv. 7.) to allude to Abel;
  and to promise to Cain the continuance of the priority of primogeniture,
  if he were reconciled to God."&mdash;<i>Remains of Bishop Sandford</i>,
  vol. i. p.&nbsp;135.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>With respect to the word <span lang="he" class="heb" title="PETACH"
  ><bdo dir="rtl">&#x5E4;&#x5B6;&#x5EA;&#x5B7;&#x5D7;</bdo></span>&#x200E;,
  the literal interpretation of which is a door, entrance, or gate,
  Archbishop Magee renders the passage thus: "A sin-offering lieth before
  or <i>at</i> the door," the word <span lang="he" class="heb"
  title="RBEITS" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E8;&#x5D1;&#x5B5;&#x5E5;</bdo></span>&#x200E; implying to
  crouch or lie down as an animal; thereby alluding to the sacrifice which
  was <!-- Page 372 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page372"></a>{372}</span>appointed for the remission of sins, and
  was typical of the great sacrifice of the Lamb of God, who was to be
  slain for the sin of the world. The whole verse would thus stand,
  according to Archbishop Magee's interpretation:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If thou doest well, shalt thou not have the excellency or
  pre-eminence? and if thou doest <i>not</i> well, a sin-offering lieth
  before the door [<i>i.e.</i> is prepared, or at hand, for thee]; and unto
  thee shall be his subjection, and thou shalt rule over him [<i>i.e.</i>
  over Abel]."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Luther's translation is at variance with this:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Wenn du fromm bist, so bist du angenehm, bist du aber nicht fromm, so
  ruhet die Sünde vor der Thür. Aber lass du ihr nicht ihren Willen,
  sondern herrsche über sie."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the margin of Luther's Bible is a reference in this verse to Rom.
  vi. 12., plainly showing that he considered it as an admonition to Cain
  to struggle against <i>sin</i>, lest it should gain the dominion over
  him.</p>

  <p>Bishop Sandford farther observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I think that neither Davison nor the other commentators have
  completely examined Gen. iv. 7. in all its expressions and bearings. I am
  surprised at Magee's omitting the argument from St. Paul's declaration,
  that by his <span title="pleiônthusia" class="grk"
  >&pi;&lambda;&epsilon;&#x1F77;&omega;&nu;&theta;&upsilon;&sigma;&#x1F77;&alpha;</span>
  Abel obtained witness that he was righteous.... I must repeat my wish to
  have the word <span lang="he" class="heb" title="PETACH" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5E4;&#x5B6;&#x5EA;&#x5B7;&#x5D7;</bdo></span>&#x200E; well
  examined."</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Dr. Glocester Ridley (quoted by Bishop Van Mildert, in the
  notes to his <i>Boyle Lectures</i>) takes the view afterwards adopted by
  Archbishop Magee, as to the meaning of the passage. (See <i>The Christian
  Passover</i>, in four sermons on the Lord's Supper, by Glocester Ridley,
  1742, p.&nbsp;14.)</p>

<h3>ROLAND THE BRAVE.</h3>

  <p>Can any of your readers and correspondents, versed in "legendary
  lore," reconcile the two different tales of which "Roland the Brave" is
  the hero? The one related in Mrs. Hemans's beautiful ballad describes him
  as reported dead, and that his fair one too rashly took the veil in
  "Nonnenwerder's cloister pale," just before his return. The story
  proceeds to tell how in grief her lover sought the battle-field, and
  finally fell, with other brave companions, at Roncesvalles.</p>

  <p>I have been surprised, when perusing Dr. Forbes's highly amusing
  narrative of his holiday in Switzerland (pp. 28-9.), to find that he
  identifies Roland with the hero of Schiller's beautiful ballad, who
  rejoiced in the unromantic appellation of <i>Ritter Toggenburg</i>.
  <i>That</i> unhappy lover, according to the poet, being rejected by his
  fair one, who could only bestow on him a sister's affection, sought the
  Holy Land in despair, and tried to forget his grief; but returning again
  to breathe the same air with his beloved, and finding her already a
  professed nun, built himself a hut, whence he could see her at her
  convent window. Here he watched day by day, as the poet beautifully says;
  and here he was found, <i>dead</i>, "still in the attitude of the
  watcher."</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Was this Ritter Toggenburg, the hero of Schiller's ballad, the nephew
  of Charlemagne, Roland, who fell at Roncesvalles? Is not Dr. Forbes in
  error in ascribing the Ritter's fate to Roland? Are they not two distinct
  persons? Or is Mrs. Hemans wrong in her version of the story? I only
  quote from memory:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Roland the Brave, the brave Roland!</p>
      <p>False tidings reach'd the Rhenish strand</p>

      <p>And thy faithful bosom swoon'd with pain,</p>
      <p>Thou fairest maid of Allemain.</p>
      <p>Why so rash has she ta'en the veil</p>
      <p>In yon Nonnenwerder's cloister pale?</p>
      <p>For the fatal vow was hardly spoken,</p>
      <p>And the fatal mantel o'er her flung.</p>
      <p>When the Drachenfels' echoes rung&mdash;</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Twas her own dear warrior's horn!</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;</p>
      <p>She died; he sought the battle plain,</p>
      <p>And loud was Gallia's wail,</p>
      <p>When Roland, the flower of chivalry,</p>
      <p>Fell at Roncesvalles!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I shall be glad to have a clear idea of the true Roland and his
  story.</p>

<h3>CLAY TOBACCO-PIPES.</h3>

  <p>An amusing treatise might be written on the variations in shape of the
  common tobacco-pipe since its first introduction into the country.
  Hundreds of specimens of old pipe-heads might soon be procured, and
  especially in the neighbourhood of London, where the same ground has been
  tilled for gardening purposes perhaps <!-- Page 373 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page373"></a>{373}</span>some hundreds of years,
  and has received fresh supplies year after year from the ash-bin and
  dust-heap. I have about a dozen in my possession, which probably belong
  to various periods from the beginning of the seventeenth to the end of
  the eighteenth century. The dearness of tobacco in the early times of its
  use is evinced by the smallness of the bowls, for many of them would hold
  at most not half a thimbleful of tobacco; while the shank, where it joins
  the bowl, is nearly double the thickness of that in use at the present
  day. If I recollect aright, the pipe as represented in Hogarth seems but
  little larger in the bowl than that in use a century before; the shape
  being in both the same, very much like that of a barrel. The sides of the
  bowl seem formerly to have been made of double or treble the thickness of
  those now in use. This will account for the good preservation in which
  they may be found after having been in the ground one or two centuries.
  The clay tobacco-pipe probably attained its present size and slimness,
  and (very nearly) its present shape, about the beginning of this century.
  I am well aware that, by many, all this will be esteemed as "in tenui
  labor," but, for my part, I look upon no reminiscences of the past,
  however humble, as deserving to be slighted or consigned to oblivion.
  Even the humble tobacco-pipe may be made the vehicle of some interesting
  information. Will any of your correspondents favour your other readers
  with some farther information on this subject?</p>

  held the manor of Cotes in socage of the king "by paying yearly one
  <i>bersethrigumnue</i>." Will any reader of "N. &amp; Q." favour me with
  its etymology or meaning? I imagine it to have been a clerical error for

  belief is, I think, that her body was interred with that of her husband
  in the Tower. But a tradition has just been communicated to me by the

  <p>It is of silver, two inches diameter. Obverse, a portrait of the
  naturalist, very faithful and boldly executed, yet with the utmost
  delicacy of finish. The face is full of thought and feeling, and the
  whole expression so spiritual, that this medallion has a strange charm;
  you keep looking at it again and again. The inscription is,</p>

<p class="cenhead">"Car. Linnæus, Arch. Reg. Equ. Auratus."</p>

  <p>On the reverse is Cybele, surrounded by animals and plants, holding a
  key and weeping. Inscription,&mdash;</p>

  <p>In the background is a bear, on whose back an ape has jumped; but the
  bear lies quietly, as if he disdained the annoyance.</p>

  <p>This was probably in reference to what he said in the preface to his

  <p><i>Gentile Names of the Jews.</i>&mdash;The Query in Vol. viii.,

  Lyon or Lyons has probably some allusion to the lion of the tribe of
  Judah, Hart to the hind of Naphtali, and Wolf to Benjamin; but the German
  Jewish names of Adler, an eagle, and Finke, a finch, cannot be so
  accounted for. The German Hirsch is evidently the same name as the
  English Hart, and the Portuguese names Lopez and Aguilar are Lupus and
  Aquila, slightly disguised. Is the origin of Mark, a very common Jewish
  name, to be sought in the Celtic <i>merch</i>, a horse?</p>

  consisted of the text (sometimes altered, I think) and notes connected

  frontispiece representing some of the characters, their heads, arms,
  bodies, and legs being dotted over with stars, as seen in a celestial
  globe. It was published about the year 1826, and was evidently not the
  first play of Shakspeare published under similar circumstances; for I
  recollect that when Brabantio first appears at the window, a note informs
  the reader that "if he will refer to the diagram of Brabantio in the

  <p><i>Ancient Family of Widderington.</i>&mdash;In an old Prayer Book,
  now before me, I find this entry:&mdash;"Ralph Witherington was married
  to Mary Smith the 13th day of Nov. in the year of our Lord 1703, at
  seaven o'clock in the morning, Sunday." Then follow the dates of the
  births of a numerous progeny. Can any of your readers tell me who these
  parties were, or any particulars about them? The early hour of a winter
  morning seems strange. Some of the children settled in Dublin, and
  intermarried with good Irish families; but from the entry in another part
  of the volume, in an older hand, of "Ralph Witharington of Hauxley, in
  the parish of Warqurth, in the county of Northumberland," the family
  appear previously to have lived in England.</p>

  <p>I have never been able to find the motto of the Widderingtons. Their
  arms are, of course, well known, viz., Quarterly, argent and gules, a
  bend sable; crest, a bull's head: but I have never seen their legend.</p>

  <p>P. S.&mdash;The marriage is not entered in the registers of Warkworth.
  It may be in some of the records (of the city) of Dublin. I have seen the
  motto "<i>Veritas Victrix</i>" appended to a coat of arms, in which the
  Widderington shield had a place; but it was believed to belong to the

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p><i>Ruin near St. Asaph, North Wales.</i>&mdash;About two miles from
  St. Asaph, in Flintshire, near to a beautiful trout stream, called, I
  think, the Elway, stands an old ruin of some ecclesiastical edifice.
  There is not very much of it now standing, but the form of the windows
  still exists. I have in vain looked in handbooks of the county for an
  account of it, but I have seen none that allude to it in any way. It is
  very secluded, being hidden by trees; and can only be approached by a
  footpath. In the centre of the edifice, there is a well of most beautiful
  water, supplied from some hidden spring; and from the bottom of which
  bubbles of gas are constantly ascending to the surface. The well is
  divided by a large stone into two parts, one evidently intended for a
  bath. The peasantry in the neighbourhood call it the Virgin Mary's Well,
  and ascribe the most astonishing cures to bathing in its waters. I could
  not, however, find out what it was. Some said it was a nunnery, and that
  the field adjoining had been a burial-ground; but all seemed remarkably
  ignorant about it, and seemed rather to avoid speaking about it; but,
  from what I could gather, there was some wild legend respecting it: but,
  being unacquainted with the language, I could not learn what it was. I
  should feed obliged if any of your correspondents could give me a
  description of it, and any information or legend connected with it. Near
  to it are the celebrated "Kaffen Rocks," which <!-- Page 376 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page376"></a>{376}</span>show undoubted
  evidence, from the shells and shingle embedded in their strata, of having
  at some period been submerged; and the caverns which exist in them are
  very large, and bones of hyenas and other animals are to be found in
  them. They are, however, very difficult to find without a guide, and
  there are very few persons in the neighbourhood who seem to know anything
  about them. They are very well worthy of a visit, and the surrounding
  scenery is beautiful in the extreme. I shall be happy to put any person
  in the way of finding them, should a desire be expressed in your
  pages.</p>

  <p><i>Wafers.</i>&mdash;When and where were wafers invented? They were no

  <i>Quarterly Review</i> says:</p>

  <p>[Respecting the antiquity of wafers, Beckmann, in his <i>History of

  notice: "M. Spiess has made an observation which may lead to farther
  researches, that the oldest seal with a red wafer he has ever yet found,
  is on a letter written by D. Krapf at Spires, in the year 1624, to the
  government of Bayreuth. M. Spiess has found also that some years after,
  Forstenhäusser, the Brandenburg factor at Nuremberg, sent such wafers to
  a bailiff at Osternohe. It appears, however, that wafers were not used
  during the whole of the seventeenth century in the chancery of
  Brandenburg, but only by private persons, and by these even seldom,
  because, as Speiss says, people were fonder of Spanish wax. The first
  wafers with which the chancery of Bayreuth began to make seals were,
  according to an expense account of the year 1705, sent from Nuremberg.
  The use of wax, however, was still continued, and among the Plassenburg
  archives there is a rescript of 1722, sealed with proper wax. The use of
  wax must have been continued longer in the Duchy of Weimar; for in the
  <i>Electa Juris Publici</i> there is an order of the year 1716, by which
  the introduction of wafers in law matters is forbidden, and the use of
  wax commanded. This order, however, was abolished by Duke Ernest Augustus
  in 1742, and wafers again introduced."]</p>

<h3>THE SONGS OF DEGREES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 121.)</p>

  <p>Too much pains cannot be expended on the elucidation of the internal
  structure of the Psalms. In this laudable endeavour, your correspondent
  <span class="sc">T.&nbsp;J. Buckton</span> has, as I conceive, fallen into an
  error. He assumes that those Psalms which are entitled "Songs of Degrees"
  were appropriated for the domestic use rather than the public services of
  the Jews. I cannot consider that the allusions to external objects which
  he enumerates could affect the argument; for, on the other hand, we find
  mention of the House of the Lord (cxxii. <!-- Page 377 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page377"></a>{377}</span>1. 9., cxxvii. 1.,
  cxxxii. 3. 7., cxxxiv. 1.); the sanctuary (cxxxiv. 2.); the priests
  (cxxxii. 9.); and the singers (cxxxiv. 1.), who attended by night as well
  as by day (1 Chron. ix. 33.): allusions which would sufficiently warrant
  these Psalms being considered as connected with the temple worship.</p>

  <p>The name <i>Shir Hammachaloth</i>, "Song of Ascents," prefixed to
  these fifteen Psalms, has given rise to much controversy. The different
  opinions as to the import of this title may be thus stated: 1. The
  ancients understood it to relate to the steps of the temple: of this
  supposition I shall speak hereafter. 2. Luther, whom Tholuck is inclined
  to follow, renders it a song in the higher choir: intimating that they
  should be sung from an elevated position, or, as Patrick says, "in an
  elevated voice." 3. Junius and Tremellius would translate it "Song of
  Excellences," or "Excellent Song." 4. Gesenius with De Wette, considers
  that this name refers to a particular rhythm, in which the sense ascends
  in a rhythming gradation; but as this barely appears in one Psalm
  (cxxi.), the facts will scarcely support the hypothesis. 5. The more
  modern opinion is, that (notwithstanding four of them being composed by
  David, and one <i>by</i> Solomon) it signifies "Song of the Ascents"
  <span title="anabasis" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&nu;&alpha;&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> or
  "Pilgrims' Song," being composed for or sung by the people during their
  journeys to Jerusalem, whether on their return from the Babylonian
  captivity, or as they statedly repaired to their national
  solemnities.</p>

  <p>The first of these hypotheses, though in least repute, I am inclined
  to prefer.</p>

  <p>The title in Chaldee is "A Song sung upon the Steps of the Abyss;" the
  Septuagint superscription "<span title="Ôdê tôn anabathmôn" class="grk"
  >&#x1F68;&delta;&#x1F74; &tau;&#x1FF6;&nu;
  &#x1F00;&nu;&alpha;&beta;&alpha;&theta;&mu;&#x1FF6;&nu;</span>;" and the
  Vulgate, <i>carmen graduum</i>, "Song of the Steps." In accordance with
  which the Jewish writers state, that these Psalms were sung on fifteen
  steps leading from the Atrium Israelis to the court of the women. In the
  apocryphal book of the "Birth of Mary," translated by Archbishop Wake,
  which is to be found in the works of St. Jerome, and which is attributed
  to St. Matthew, there is an account of a miracle in the early history of
  the Virgin Mary, in which it is said (ch. iv.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"2. And there were about the temple, according to the fifteen Psalms
  of Degrees, fifteen stairs to ascend.</p>

  <p>"3. For the temple being built in a mountain, the altar of
  burnt-offering, which was without, could not be come near but by
  stairs."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It goes on to state how the infant Mary miraculously walked up these
  stairs. In the account of the same miracle, in the <i>Protevangelion</i>,
  ascribed to St. James, it is related (ch. vii.) how the priest&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"5. ... placed her (the infant) upon the third <i>step of the
  altar</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From this comparison it would appear, that the "stairs about the
  temple" were synonymous with the "steps of the altar."</p>

  <p>I would therefore suggest, for the consideration of those better
  acquainted with the subject, that these Psalms were adapted to be sung
  (not <i>on</i> the steps, as some think, but) as a kind of introit while
  the priests ascended the steps of the altar.</p>

  <p>To show their adaptation for this purpose, it may be worth remarking,
  that they are all, except cxxxii., introits in the first Prayer Book of
  Edward VI.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN POEMS IMPUTED TO ENGLISH AUTHORS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 71. 183.)</p>

  <p>The southern part of the U. S. seems to make as free with the
  reputations of English authors, as the northern with their copyright. The
  name of the South Carolina newspaper, which, with so much confirmatory
  evidence, ascribed <i>The Calm</i> to Shelley, is not given. If it was
  the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>, the editor has been at it again.
  The following began to appear in the English papers about Christmas last,
  and is still "going the round:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">The Sorrows of Werther.</span>&mdash;The <i>Southern

  Editor's Table,' the following comic poem of Thackeray's; written, we are
  told, 'one morning last spring in the <i>Messenger</i> office,' during a
  call made by the author:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Werther had a love for Charlotte,</p>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Charlotte was a married lady,</p>
      <p class="i1">And a moral man was Werther;</p>
      <p>And for all the wealth of Indies,</p>
      <p class="i1">Would do nothing that might hurt her.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'So he sigh'd, and pined, and ogled,</p>

      <p class="i1">Went on cutting bread and butter.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</blockquote>

  <p>I believe that Mr. Thackeray knows the value of his writings and his
  time too well to <i>whittle</i> at verses in the <i>Messenger</i> office,
  and leave his chips on the floor; and that he is too observant of the
  laws of fair wit to make a falsification and call it a burlesque. <i>The
  Sorrows of Werther</i> is not so popular as when known here chiefly by a
  wretched version of a wretched French version, and many who read these
  stanzas will be satisfied that the <!-- Page 378 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page378"></a>{378}</span>last conveys, at worst,
  a distorted notion of the end of Göthe's story. To prevent this
  misapprehension, I quote from Mr. Boylan's translation all that is told
  of Charlotte after Werther's suicide:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The servant ran for a surgeon, and then went to fetch Albert.
  Charlotte heard the ringing of the bell; a cold shudder seized her. She
  wakened her husband, and they both rose. The servant, bathed in tears,
  faltered forth the dreadful news. <i>Charlotte fell senseless at Albert's
  feet.</i></p>

  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .</p>

  <p>"The steward and his sons followed the corpse to the grave. Albert was
  unable to accompany them. <i>Charlotte's life was despaired of.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Perhaps "despaired of" is too strong a word for "man <i>fürchtete
  für</i> Lottens Leben;" but there is no peg on which to hang the poor
  joke of the last stanza.</p>

<h3>"FEATHER IN YOUR CAP."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 220.)</p>

  <p>In reply to <span class="sc">Mr. Gatty's</span> question, I beg to
  state that the Indian wears an eagle's feather for every enemy he has
  slain. I have seen a boy of fifteen thus decorated, and was assured that
  it had been lawfully won.</p>

  <p>The feather is usually stuck into the hinder part of the turban, or
  head-dress, and either projects straight out, or hangs down the back.
  This is exactly the fashion in which the Chinese wear the peacock's
  feather; and it also is a mark of distinction for warriors, a military
  institution similar to our knighthood, or, perhaps, what knighthood once
  was. (See De Guignes and Barrow, &amp;c.) I think M&lsquo;Kenzie speaks
  of the eagle's feather, but cannot quote just now. According to
  Elphinstone, the "Caufirs of Caubul" (Siah-posh?) stick a long feather in
  their turbans for every Mussulman they have slain.</p>

  <p>The similarity of style in wearing their feathers, and, above all, the
  coincidence of both being the reward of merit, induces a belief that in
  times long gone by a relationship may have existed between the Chinese
  and the American; a belief that is strengthened by other and more curious
  testimony than even this.</p>

  <p>The head-dress, or coronet of upright feathers, to which <span
  class="sc">Mr. Gatty</span> seems to allude, I have never heard of, as
  associated with warlike deeds. The coronet of feathers, moreover, does
  not appear to have been peculiar to America. In the <i>Athenæum</i> for
  1844 is given the representation of a naval engagement, in which one
  party of the combatants "wear head-dresses of feathers, such as are
  described in ancient Hindu records, and such as the Indian Caciques wore
  when America was discovered by Columbus," &amp;c. (p. 172.). Moreover,
  "the Lycians had caps adorned with crests, stuck round with feathers,"
  &amp;c. (Meyrick's <i>Ancient Armour</i>, &amp;c., vol. i. p.&nbsp;xviii.) We
  may suppose this to have resembled the coiffure of the Mexican and other
  North American tribes.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rankin says the Peruvian Incas wore, as a distinction, two plumes
  on the front of the head, similar to those represented in the portraits
  of Tamerlane. (See <i>Conquest by the Mogols, &amp;c.</i>, p. 175.) I
  have seen, among the Wyandots of Sandusky, heads which one might suppose
  had been the originals of the portraits given in his plate: turban made
  of gaudy-coloured silk, with two short thick feathers stuck upright in
  front; the one red, the other white tipped with blue, the great
  desideratum being to have them of different colours, as strongly
  contrasted as possible.</p>

  <p>The Kalmucs, when they celebrate any great festival, always wear
  coloured owls' feathers in their caps, &amp;c. (See <i>Strahlenburg</i>,
  4to., p.&nbsp;434.) The Dacotas also wear owls' feathers. (See Long's
  <i>Expedition to Rocky Mountains</i>, vol. i. p.&nbsp;161.) The Usbeck Tartar
  chiefs wore (perhaps <i>do</i> wear) plumes of herons' feathers in their
  turbans; and the herons' plume of the Ottoman sultan is only a remnant of
  the costume in which their ancestors descended from Central Asia.</p>

<h3>PERSPECTIVE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 300.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. G. T. Hoare</span> is rather
  bold in describing the case he does as a "very common error;" and I
  cannot agree with him that the façade of Sennacherib's Palace (Layard's
  2nd book on <i>Nineveh</i>) is an instance of the kind. The theory that
  horizontal lines in the plane of the picture should converge to a point
  on the horizontal line right and left of the visual ray, is by no means
  new; in truth, every line according to this view must form the segment of
  a circle more or less, according to circumstances. Apply this principle
  to the vertical lines of a tower or lofty building, and every such
  structure must be represented diminished at the top, the vertical lines
  converging to a vanishing point in the sky.</p>

  <p>Some years since, this theory was brought forward by Mr. Parsey, and
  the subject fully discussed at scientific meetings. There was much
  ingenuity in the arguments employed, but the illustrations were so
  unsatisfactory that the system has never gained ground. The principles of
  perspective are most ably exemplified in many well-known works, as they
  set forth very satisfactory modes of delineation. The limits of your
  periodical prevent a fuller correspondence on this subject, or I think it
  would not be difficult to <!-- Page 379 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page379"></a>{379}</span>satisfy <span class="sc">Mr. Hoare</span>
  that there are great difficulties attending his proposition.</p>

  <p>No recent discoveries in the art of perspective have tended to more
  truthful representations than those produced by the recognised systems
  usually adopted. The method of showing the internal courts, &amp;c. of
  large groups of buildings by isometrical perspective, although very
  useful for developing architects' and engineers' projects, is not a
  system that will bear the test of close examination.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Benj. Ferrey.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">G. T. Hoare</span> is quite right in saying "that
  every line above or below the line of the horizon, though <i>really</i>
  parallel to it, <i>apparently</i> approaches it, as it is produced to the
  right or left." But he seems to forget that the same holds good in the
  picture as in the original landscape, the part opposite the eye being
  nearer to it than the margin of the paper. To produce the same effect
  with <i>converging lines</i>, the drawing must be made to assume the form
  of a segment of a circle, the eye being placed in the centre.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John P. Stilwell.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Dorking.</p>

  <p>I must beg leave to differ most decidedly with <span class="sc">Mr. G.
  T. Hoare</span> on this point. If it is in accordance with the principles
  of perspective that, supposing the eye and the picture in their true
  positions in relation to each other and to the objects represented, every
  line drawn from the eye to any point of a real object will pass through
  its corresponding point in the picture, then the supposed wall will form
  the base of a pyramid, of which the eye will be the apex, and the
  representation of the wall in the picture a section parallel to the base,
  and consequently mathematically similar to the base itself. It is
  perfectly true, as <span class="sc">Mr. Hoare</span> says, "that every
  line above or below the line of the horizon, though <i>really</i>
  parallel to it, <i>apparently</i> approaches it, as it is produced to the
  right or left." But he forgets that this fact applies to the picture as
  well as to the object. In fact, the picture is an object, and the
  parallel lines in it representing the wall must have the same apparent
  tendency to one another as those in the wall itself.</p>

  <p class="address">Dublin.</p>

  <p>I am glad <span class="sc">Mr. G. T. Hoare</span> has called attention
  to the defective state of the art of perspective. His remarks, however,
  are too narrow. The fact is, that <i>any</i> two parallel straight lines
  appear to converge at one or both ends, <i>and one or both lines assume a
  curvilinear shape</i>. For a notable example, the vertical section of the
  Duke of York's column in Waterloo Place, from all points of view, appears
  to bulge at the point of sight, and to taper upwards by a curvilinear
  convergence of the sides.</p>

<h3>LORD FAIRFAX.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 10.)</p>

  <p>The following is all the information which I have been able to collect
  respecting the present possessor of the title of Fairfax of Cameron, in
  answer to the third Query of W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M. It gives me pleasure to communicate
  it.</p>

  <p>The Lords Fairfax have been for several generations natives of the
  United States. The present possessor of the title is not so called, but
  is known as <i>Mr.</i> Fairfax. He resides at present in Suter County,
  California. His Christian names are George William.</p>

  <p>The gentleman who bore the title at the commencement of the present
  century, was a zealous member of the republican (now called democratic)
  party.</p>

  <p>The Fairfax family, at one time, owned all that portion of Virginia
  called the Northern Neck, lying between the Potomac and Rappahannock
  rivers.</p>

  <p>So much for the <i>third</i> Query. I beg leave to add a few remarks
  suggested by the <i>fifth</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>citizens</i> of the United States are not called
  <i>subjects</i> of the United States, and for the same reason that your
  excellent Queen is not called a subject of Great Britain. Native citizens
  take no oath of citizenship, expressly or <i>impliedly</i>, whatever the
  latter word may mean. Foreigners, who become naturalised, do not renounce
  allegiance to the sovereign of Great Britain more "pointedly" than to any
  other sovereign. Every one renounces his allegiance to the potentate or
  power under whose sway he was born: the Englishman to the King (or Queen)
  of Great Britain, the Chinese to the Emperor of China, the Swiss to the
  republic of Switzerland, and so of others.</p>

  <p>W. H. M. says that the existence of the peers of Scotland "is denial

  W.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;M. will turn to this constitution, he will find that he has
  confounded the Declaration of Independence with it.</p>

  <p>Foreigners, on becoming naturalised, have to renounce their titles of
  nobility; but I know of nothing to prevent a native American citizen from
  being called Lord, as well as Mr. or Esq. As above mentioned, a Lord
  Fairfax was so called twenty-six years after our Independence; and Lord
  Stirling, who was a Major-General in the American army of the Revolution,
  was always so styled by his cotemporaries, and addressed by them as "My
  Lord" and "Your Lordship."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Within full view of Mount Vernon, separated therefrom by water only,
  is one of the most beautiful seats on the river for sale, but of greater
  magnitude than you seem to have contemplated. It is called Belvoir, and
  belonged to George Wm Fairfax; who, were he now living, would be Baron of
  Cameron, as his younger brother in this country (George Wm. dying without
  issue) at present is, though he does not take upon himself the title.
  This seat was the residence of the above-named gentleman before he went
  to England ... At present it belongs to Thomas Fairfax, son of Bryan
  Fairfax: the gentleman who will not, as I said before, take upon himself
  the title of Baron of Cameron."</p>

  <p>I cannot but deem your correspondents W.&nbsp;W. and H.&nbsp;G. in error when
  they consider that the name of Baron Fairfax ought not to be retained in
  the Peerage. The able heraldic editors of the Peerages are likely to be
  better versed in such matters than to have perpetrated and perpetuated so
  frequently the blunder; or what is to be said of Sir Bernard Burke's
  elevation to be a king of arms? Not to omit the instance of the Earl of
  Athlone, who, though a natural-born subject of a foreign realm, in 1795
  took his seat in the House of Lords in Ireland (a case which H.&nbsp;G. wants
  explained), we have a more recent instance in the case of the present
  King of Hanover, a foreign potentate, who is Duke of Cumberland and
  Teviotdale by inheritance, in our peerage, and whose coronation oath (of
  allegiance?) must be quite incompatible with the condition of a
  <i>subject</i> in another state. I confess I should like to see this
  explained, as well as the position of those (amongst whom, however, Lord
  Fairfax now ranks) who, while strictly mere subjects and citizens of
  their own state, may have had conferred upon themselves, or inherit,
  titles of dignity and privilege in a foreign one. We usually (as in the
  case of the Rothschilds, &amp;c.) acknowledge their highest title in
  address, but without any adjective or epithets to qualify with honor,
  such as "honorable;" as is the case, too, with doctors of foreign
  universities, whose title from courtesy we also admit, though this does
  not place them on a footing with those of England. The present Duke of
  Wellington and the Earl Nelson inherit, I believe, titles of dignity in
  foreign lands, though natural-born subjects of this realm; and there can
  hardly be a doubt that Lord Fairfax inherits correctly his British
  barony, though, whenever he may exercise for the first time a
  <i>legal</i> vote, he may have to exhibit proof of his being the very
  heir and person qualified, merely because born and resident in a foreign
  state; the same as would in such case doubtless occur with regard to the
  other noble persons I have referred to.</p>

  <p>I have before me a copy of this very interesting document, together
  with an <i>Epistole Joannis Sturmii de eadem re, ad Cardinales cæterosque
  viros ad eam Consultationem delectos</i>, printed at Strasburg ("ex

  1538. The report of the Committee had reached Sturmius in the month of
  March, 1537-8; and his critique, addressed especially to Contarini, bears
  the date "tertio Non. Aprilis." As it is a somewhat scarce pamphlet, two
  or three extracts may not be unacceptable to the readers of "N. &amp;
  Q."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Had <span class="sc">Mr. Woodward's</span> remarks come sooner under
  notice, they should have received, as well deserving, a quicker reply. It
  is in one sense rather annoying that he should have mistaken so widely
  the publication under question, and spent so much time in confirming what
  few, if any, now doubt, of the Papal origin of the <i>Consilium
  Delectorum Cardinalium</i>. (See Gibbings' Preface to his <i>Reprint of
  the Roman Index Expurgatorius</i>, p. xx.) The title of the tract (so to
  speak) commonly attributed to the same quarter, but the justice of which
  is questioned, is, <i>Consilium quorundam Episcoporum Bononiæ
  congregatorum, quod de ratione stabiliendæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ</i> Julio III.
  P.M. <i>datum est</i>. <i>This</i> is the <i>Consilium</i> to which <span
  class="sc">Mr. Woodward</span>'s attention should have been confined; and
  which he will find in the same volume of Brown's <i>Fasciculus</i>, to
  which he has referred me on the real <i>Consilium</i>, pp. 644-650. It
  appears in English also, translated by Dr. Clagett, in Bishop Gibson's
  <i>Preservative</i>, vol. i. p.&nbsp;170. edit. 8vo.; and is also included (a
  point to be noticed) in the single volume published of Vergerio's
  <i>Works</i>, Tubingen, 1563.<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Woodward</span> has no doubt frequently met, in
  Protestant authors, with the quotation from this supposed Bologna Council
  (<i>Consilium</i> being taken for <i>Concilium</i>), recommending that as
  little as possible of the Scriptures should be suffered to come abroad
  among the vulgar, that having proved the grand source of the present
  calamities. Now the very air of this passage, and of course of many
  others rather less disguised, is of itself sufficient to prove that this
  Bologna Council is a piece of banter; the workmanship, in fact, of Peter
  Paul Vergerio. Would any <i>real</i> adherent of Rome so express himself?
  "N.&amp; Q." (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;111.) supplies a ready answer, in the
  communication from F.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;H. on the so-called Catholic Bible Society.</p>

  <p>Would a real adherent of the Papal Church again express himself in the
  following <i>unimpassioned</i> manner?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Nam Apostolorum temporibus (ut verum tibi fateamur, sed silentio opus
  est) vel aliquot annis post ipsos Apostolos, nulla vel Papatus, vel
  Cardinalatus mentio erat, nec amplissimos illos reditus Episcopatuum et
  Sacerdotiorum fuisse constat, nec templa tantis sumptibus extruebantur,
  &amp;c.: æstimet ergo tua sanctitas quam male nobiscum ageretur, si
  nostro aliquo fato in pristinam paupertatem humilitatem et miseram illam
  servitutem ac potestatem alienam redigendi essemus!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Deinde ubi Episcopi Sacerdotum palmas tantum inungunt, jube illos

  certe olei quantitas majorem quoque sanctificandi vim obtinebit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To be sure! Who can doubt it?</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Woodward</span> will, I apprehend, readily agree
  that these sentences come from no one connected with the Roman Church.
  And they are quoted in the hope that Protestants will cease to cite this
  supposed Bologna Council as any valid or genuine testimony to Romish
  proceedings and sentiments.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Mounting Positives.</i>&mdash;If the print and the mounting paper,
  or Bristol board, are <i>both</i> made equally damp, and the back of the
  picture covered with thin paste, they adhere without any unevenness; and
  if the print is on the fine Canson's paper, the appearance is that of an
  India proof. They should remain until <i>perfectly dry</i> in a
  press.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">H. W. Diamond.</span></p>

  <p><i>Mounting of Photographs, and Difficulties in the Wax-paper
  Process.</i>&mdash;May I request a little additional information from
  your correspondent <span class="sc">Seleucus</span>, Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;310.,
  respecting the mounting of photographs? Does he mean merely the painting
  the edges, or the smearing of the photograph all over its back with the
  Indian-rubber glue, prior to sticking the proof on the cardboard? If the
  former, which I apprehend he does, <span class="sc">Seleucus</span> will
  necessarily have the unsightly appearance of the picture's buckling up in
  the middle on the board being bent forward and backward in different
  directions? May I take the liberty of asking him in what respect the plan
  proposed is superior to that of painting over the edges with mucilage of
  gum arabic, containing a little brown sugar to prevent its cracking,
  allowing it to dry, and prior to the placing it on the card, slightly
  moistening it; a plan superior to that of putting it on the board at
  first, as all risk of a portion of the gum oozing out at the edges is
  thereby avoided.</p>

  <p>I have long been in the habit of mounting prints and photographs in a
  way which prevents their buckling, keeps the paper underneath quite
  smooth, and in other respects is so perfect, that it positively defies
  the distinguishing of the picture from the paper on which it is mounted.
  I am not certain that my plan is applicable to the mounting on
  card-board, as it cannot be wetted and stretched, thinking it useless to
  make use of such a costly material when a tolerably thick drawing-paper
  will more than serve the same purpose at a very considerably less
  expense, seeing that the photograph thus mounted bears a much closer
  resemblance <!-- Page 382 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page382"></a>{382}</span>to that of a good and costly print. A good
  plain or tinted sheet of drawing-paper, 30 inches by 22, may be obtained
  at the artists' colour shops for sixpence, sufficiently large for two
  drawings, 9 inches by 11, allowing a sufficient margin.</p>

  <p>After various trials, the plan I have found decidedly the best is the
  following:&mdash;Soak the drawing-paper in a vessel of water for ten
  minutes, or until it appears by its flaccidity to have become perfectly
  saturated; put it at once into an artist's stretching frame, brush over
  the back of the photograph with rather thin and perfectly smooth paste,
  allow it a few minutes to imbibe a portion of the moisture of the paste,
  and then lay it smoothly down on the damp paper now on the stretching
  frame, of course carefully pressing out all air bubbles as you gradually,
  beginning at one side, smooth down the pasted picture. It should remain
  in a dry place (not placed before a fire) until the whole has become
  quite dry, about ten or twelve hours. It may then be taken out of the
  frame, cut to the desired shape, and a single or double line nicely drawn
  around the picture, at a distance suitable to each individual's taste, by
  the help of sepia-coloured ink and a crowquill pen, both of which may
  also be bought at the artists' colour shop. Should it be required to be
  still more nicely mounted, and to appear to have been one and the same
  paper originally, the back edges of the picture should, previous to
  laying on the paste, be rubbed down to a fine and knife-like edge with a
  piece of the finest sand-paper placed on a wine cork, or substance of a
  similar size. The drawing-paper should be of the same shade and tint as
  the ground of the photograph.</p>

  <p>A novice in the wax-paper process (having heretofore worked the
  collodion and calotype, from its very desirable property of keeping long
  good after being excited, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the wax paper), I am very desirous
  of getting over an unexpected difficulty in its manipulation; and if some
  one of the many liberal-minded contributors to your justly wide-spread
  periodical, well versed in that department of the art, would lend me a
  helping hand in my present difficulty, I should feel more than obliged
  for the kindness thereby conferred.</p>

  <p>My wax-paper negative, much to my disappointment, occasionally
  exhibits, more or less, a speckled appearance by transmitted light, which
  frequently, in deep painting, impresses the positive with an unsightly
  spotted character, somewhat similar to that of a bad lithograph taken
  from a worn-out stone. I should wish my wax-paper negative to be similar
  in appearance to that of a good calotype one, or to show by transmitted
  light, as my vexatious specimen does when viewed on its right side by
  reflected light. As the most lucid description must fall far short of a
  sight of the article itself, I purpose enclosing you a specimen of my
  failure, a portion of one of the negatives in question. Would immersion,
  instead of floating on the gallo-nitrate solution, remedy the evil? Or
  should the impressed sheet be entirely immersed in the developing fluid
  in place of being floated? And if in the affirmative, of what strength
  should it be? I have thus far tried both plans in vain.</p>

  <p><i>The New Waxed-paper, or Céroléine Process.</i>&mdash;The following
  process, communicated to the French paper <i>Cosmos</i> by M. Stephane
  Geoffroy, and copied into <i>La Lumière,</i> appears to possess many of
  the advantages of the wax-paper, while it gets rid of those blemishes of
  which so many complain. I have therefore thought it deserving the
  attention of English photographers, and so send a translation of it to
  '"N. &amp; Q." As I have preserved the French measures&mdash;the
  <i>litre</i> and the <i>gramme</i>&mdash;I may remind those who think
  proper to repeat M. Geoffroy's experiments, that the former is equal to
  about 2 pints and 2 ounces of our measure; and that the <i>gramme</i> is
  equal to 15.438 grains, nearly 15½.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Anon.</span></p>

  <p>I send you a complete description of a method for either wet or dry
  paper, which has many advantages over that of Mr. Le Gray.</p>

  <p>I assure you it is excellent; and its results are always produced in a
  manner so easy, so simple, and so certain, that I think I am doing great
  service to photographers in publishing it.</p>

  <p>1st. I introduce 500 grammes of yellow or white wax into 1 litre of
  spirits of wine, of the strength usually sold, in a glass retort. I boil
  the alcohol till the wax is completely dissolved (first taking care to
  place at the end of my retort an apparatus, by means of which I can
  collect all the produce of the distillation). I pour into a measure the
  mixture which remains in the retort while liquid; while it is getting
  cool, the myricine and the cerine harden or solidify, and the céroléine
  remains alone in solution in the alcohol. I separate this liquid by
  straining it through fine linen; and by a last operation, I filter it
  through a paper in a glass funnel, after having mixed with it the alcohol
  resulting the distillation. I keep in reserve this liquor in a
  stopper-bottle, and make use of it as I want it, after having mixed it in
  the following manner.</p>

  <p>2nd. Next I dissolve, in 150 grammes of alcohol, of 36 degrees of
  strength, 20 grammes of iodide of ammonium (or, of potassium), 1 gramme
  of bromide of ammonium or potassium, 1 gramme of fluoride of potassium or
  ammonium.</p>

  <p>I then pour, drop by drop, upon about 1 gramme of fresh-made iodide of
  silver a concentrated solution of cyanide of potassium, only just
  sufficient to dissolve it.</p>

  <p>I add this dissolved iodide of silver to the preceding mixture, and
  shake it up: there remains, as a sediment at the bottom of the bottle, a
  considerable thickness of all the above salts, which serve to saturate
  the alcohol by which I replace successively the saturated which I have
  extracted by degrees in the proportions below.</p>

  <p>3rd. Having these two bottles ready, when I wish to prepare negatives,
  I take about 200 grammes of the solution No. 1. of céroléine and alcohol,
  with which I mix 20 grammes of the solution No. 2.; I filter the mixture
  with care, to avoid the crystals which are not dissolved, which always
  soil the paper; and in a porcelain tray I make a bath, into which I lay
  to soak for <!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page383"></a>{383}</span>about a quarter of an hour the papers
  selected and cut, five or six at a time, till the liquor is exhausted.
  Taken out, hung up by the corner, and dried, these papers, which have
  taken a uniform rosy tint, are shut up free from dust, and kept dry. With
  regard to the sensitizing by nitrate of silver, the bringing out of the
  image under the action of gallic acid, and fixing the proof by
  hyposulphite of soda, I follow the usual methods, most frequently that of
  Mr. Le Gray.</p>

  <p>I add only, if I have any dissolved, 1 or 2 grammes of camphorated
  spirits to 1 litre of the solution of gallic acid.</p>

  <p>Allow me, Sir, to say a few words on the great advantages I have
  always remarked in preparing my negatives by this method.</p>

  <p>All those who use papers waxed by Mr. Le Gray's process, know how
  many, how tedious, and how difficult are the operations before the
  sensitizing by nitrate of silver. They know too how much care is
  necessary to obtain papers uniformly prepared and without spots, in the
  midst of such long operations, in which there are so many opportunities
  for accidents. In fact, one must be always upon one's guard against the
  impurities of the wax obtained from the shop; against the dust during the
  impregnation of the paper; and, while using the iron, against the
  over-heating of the latter, and against the bad quality of the paper used
  to blot.</p>

  <p>Photographers know also how much wax they lose by this process, and
  how much it costs for the quantities of paper necessary to dry it
  properly. They know likewise how difficult and tedious it is to soak a
  waxed paper which has been previously in a watery solution. On the
  contrary, by the method I have described, the iodizing and the waxing is
  done by one single, simple, and rapid process; the saturation is, as may
  be conceived, very uniform, and very complete, thanks to the power of
  penetration possessed by the alcohol; and that marbled appearance of the
  ordinary waxed proofs, which is so annoying, cannot be produced by this
  method, thanks to the character of the céroléine: this body is, in fact,
  of a remarkable elasticity.</p>

  <p>The solution of céroléine in the alcohol is more easy to prepare, and
  comparatively costs little; and the remains of stearine and of myricine
  can either be sold again, or, in any case, may be used to wax fixed
  proofs.</p>

  <p>The solution of which I have given you the formula, is photogenic to a
  very high degree; in fact, used with papers, either thin or stout, it
  gives, after the first bath of gallic acid, blacks of an intensity truly
  remarkable; which it is impossible to obtain to the same degree with Le
  Gray's paper, and which other papers scarcely take after having been done
  a second time with the acetic acid, or the bichloride of mercury. At the
  same time, it preserves the lights and the half-tones in a way that
  surprises me upon each new trial (I have not yet been able to obtain one
  clear proof by gallic acid, with the addition of nitrate of silver). The
  transparency of the proofs is always admirable, and the clearness of the
  object yields in nothing to that of the proofs obtained by albumen.</p>

  <p>The paper, prepared in the manner I have described, is also very quick
  as compared with Le Gray's paper&mdash;at least one fourth quicker; and
  preserves its perfect sensitiveness in the same proportion of time, three
  days in twelve. Thus, it is at the same time quicker and less variable.
  This comparative rapidity may be very well understood, by remembering
  that the céroléine is an element much softer than its compound; and
  possesses a photogenic aptness which is peculiar to itself, which science
  will, no doubt, soon explain.</p>

  <p>To succeed in the preparation of the céroléine, it is important to
  work with wax of the best quality; this is not easy in Paris, where they
  sell, under the name of wax, a resinous matter which is only wax in
  appearance. It will be well to observe, with the greatest care, the smell
  and the look of a fresh cut.</p>

<h3>Replies to Minor Queries.</h3>

  <p><i>Origin of Clubs</i> (Vol. ix., p.&nbsp;327.).&mdash;Johnson's definition
  of club, as "an assembly of good fellows, meeting under certain
  conditions," will apply to a meeting held two centuries earlier than that
  established by Sir Walter Raleigh at the Mermaid, in Friday Street. In
  the reign of Henry IV., there was a Club called "La Court de bone
  Compagnie," of which Occleve was a member, and probably Chaucer. In the
  works of the former are two ballads, written about 1413, one a
  congratulation from the brethren to Henry Somer, on his appointment as
  Sub-Treasurer of the Exchequer; and the other a reminder to the same
  person, that the "styward" had warned him that he was&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That there were certain conditions to be observed by this Society,
  appears from the latter epistle, which commences with an answer to a
  letter of remonstrance the "Court" has received from Henry Somer against
  some undue extravagance, and a breach of their rules. They were evidently
  a jovial company; and such a history as could be collected of these
  Societies would be both interesting and curious. We have proof that Henry
  Somer received Chaucer's pension for him.</p>

  originated; from the fact of a pillar, with a circular plate of copper
  upon it, having stood in a piazza under the Exchange in this ancient
  city: which pillar was called "the nail." Permit me to remark, Bristol
  also claims the origin of this saying: vide the following paragraph in
  No. 1. p.&nbsp;4. of the <i>Curiosities of Bristol</i>, published last
  September:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We have heard it stated that this phrase first originated in Bristol,
  when it was common for the merchants to buy and sell at the bronze
  pillars (four) in front of the Exchange&mdash;the pillars being commonly
  called <i>Nails</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I should infer that, from the fact of Bristol having been at the time
  of the erection of these pillars (some centuries ago) by far the most
  important place in the British empire (London only excepted), it is more
  likely to have originated this commercial saying than Limerick.</p>

  <p>"<i>Man proposes, but God disposes</i>" (Vol. ix., pp. 87.
  202.).&mdash;I regret that I am unable to afford <span class="sc">Mr.
  Thomas</span> any information respecting the Abbot Gerson, to whom the
  authorship of the <i>De Imitatione</i> has been attributed, beyond what
  is contained in the preface to the edition which I before quoted. The
  authority there cited is a dissertation, entitled <i>Mémoire sur le
  véritable auteur de l'Imitation de Jésus-Christ</i>, par G. de Gregory,
  Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur, etc., Paris, 1827. The contents of this
  work are thus described in that preface:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Eques de Gregory argumentis tum externis, tum internis
  demonstrat:&mdash;1. Libellum&mdash;primitus tractatum fuisse ethicæ
  scholasticum, a magistro novitiorum elaboratum. 2. Eundem, tempore inter
  annum 1220 et 1240 interjecto, suppresso nomine conscriptum esse a Joanne
  Gerson, monacho Benedictino, antea in Athenæo Vercellensi professore,
  postea ibidem monasterii S. Stephani abbate. Denique specialibus
  argumentis eos refellit, qui vel Joanni Gersoni, cancellario academiæ
  Parisiensi, vel Thomæ Kempensi hunc librum attribuendum esse
  contendunt."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have been informed that an interesting article upon the question of
  the authorship has recently appeared in a very recent number of a Roman
  Catholic Review; I believe Brownson's <i>American Quarterly.</i></p>

  <p class="author">H. P.</p>

  <p class="address">Lincoln's Inn.</p>

  <p>H. P. wishes for some other quotations from <i>De Imitatione
  Christi</i>, in order to test the claims to originality of that
  extraordinary work; I therefore now supply another&mdash;"Of two evils we
  ought always to choose the least,"&mdash;because I strongly suspect that
  it is even some centuries older than the time of the author, Thomas à
  Kempis. It will be found in b. III. ch. xii. of the English
  translation.</p>

  <p><i>Roman Catholic Patriarchs</i> (Vol. viii., p. 317.).&mdash;The
  following, with the signature <span class="sc">W. Fraser</span>, appeared
  in "N. &amp; Q.":</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Has any bishop of the Western Church held the title of patriarch,
  besides the Patriarch of Venice? And what peculiar authority or
  privileges has he?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Archbishop of Lisbon has the title of Patriarch of the Indies; but
  it does not appear that he has any defined jurisdiction, being only an
  inferior patriarch, and with a title little more than honorary. His grand
  vicars, however, are archbishops; and his seal has, like those of other
  patriarchs, the tiara encircled with two crowns only. This patriarchate
  was created by Pope Clement XI., by his constitution <i>In supremo
  Apostolatus</i>. Afterwards, in the year 1720, the same Pope conferred
  upon the Patriarch of Lisbon the exclusive right of anointing the Kings
  of Portugal at their coronation on the right arm, which had previously
  been the privilege of the Archbishop of Braga.</p>

  <p class="author">F. C. H.</p>

  <p>The primate of Portugal has the style of "patriarch," but I do not
  know of any privileges or authority that he has beyond those appertaining
  to the rank of archbishop or cardinal, when he happens to be one, as at
  present.</p>

  <p><i>Classic Authors and the Jews</i> (Vol. ix., p. 221.).&mdash;In
  Smith's <i>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography</i> a few references
  are given, under the words "Herodes," "Hyrcanus," &amp;c., to classical
  authors who refer to the Jewish people, their country and customs.
  Probably many more will be given in the <i>Dictionary of Geography</i>,
  under the words "Palestine," "Jerusalem," &amp;c., when the work is
  completed. To suppose that the classical authors allude but seldom to the
  Jews is a mistake. Roman writers of the post-Augustan period abound in
  allusions to them. I can supply <!-- Page 385 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page385"></a>{385}</span>B.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;C. with a few. The <i>Histories</i>
  of Tacitus refer to them in almost every page, and book v. especially
  contains an account of their origin, institutions, chief city, and
  temple. Juvenal also has frequent allusions to their customs and habits,
  <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> Sat. iii. 14., xiv. 101. &amp;c.; see also Horace's
  <i>Satires</i>, <span class="scac">I.</span> iv. 143., <span
  class="scac">I.</span> v. 100., and <span class="scac">I.</span> ix. 70.,

  <span class="scac">XXXI.</span> viii. 44.; Quint., <span

  work which gives <i>all</i> the passages in classical authors referring
  to the Jews.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Francis J. Leachman, B.A.</span></p>

  <p>In answer to your correspondent B. H. C., I beg to say that I have
  found out the following passages in classic authors bearing on Judea and
  the Jews, all of which I have authenticated myself, except where I had
  not the book at hand:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Tacitus. Annales, ii. 85.; xii. 23. 54.; xv. 44.</p>

  <p><i>Mawkin</i> (Vol. ix., p. 303.).&mdash;An attempt to explain the
  origin of the word <i>maukin</i>, or <i>malkin</i>, may be seen in the
  <i>Philological Museum</i>, vol. i. p. 681. (See also Halliwell's Dict.,
  in <i>Malkin</i> and <i>Maulkin</i>.) The most probable derivation of the
  word is, that <i>malkin</i> is a diminutive of <i>mal</i>, abbreviated
  from <i>Mary</i>, now commonly written <i>Moll.</i> Hence, by successive
  changes, <i>malkin</i> or <i>maukin</i> might mean a dirty wench, a
  figure of old rags dressed up as a scarecrow, and a mop of rags used for
  cleaning ovens. The Scotch <i>maukin</i>, for a hare, seems to be an
  instance of an animal acquiring a proper name, like <i>renard</i> in
  French, and <i>jack</i> for <i>pike</i> in English.</p>

  <p class="author">L.</p>

  <p><i>Mantelpiece</i> (Vol. ix., p. 302.).&mdash;<i>French</i>, Manteau
  de cheminée. <i>German</i>, Kamin Mantel. This is the moulding, or
  mantle, that serves to hide (screen) the joint betwixt the wall and the
  fire-stove.</p>

  <p class="author">H. F. B.</p>

  <p><i>Mousehunt</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 65, 135.).&mdash;A short time ago I
  was informed by a gamekeeper, that this little animal is found in the
  Holt Forest. He told me that there are three kinds of the weasel tribe in
  the woods: the weasel, the stoat or stump, and the <i>mousehunt</i> or
  <i>mousehunter</i>, which is also called the <i>thumb</i>, from its
  diminutive size. It feeds on mice and small birds; but my informant does
  not think that it attacks game.</p>

  <p>White of Selbourne mentions that such an animal was supposed to exist
  in his neighbourhood:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Some intelligent country people have a notion that we have, in these
  parts, a species of the genus <i>Mustelinum,</i> besides the weasel,
  stoat, ferret, and polecat: a little reddish beast, not much bigger than
  a field-mouse, but much longer, which they call a <i>cane</i>. This piece
  of intelligence can be little depended on; but farther inquiry may be
  made."&mdash;<i>Natural History of Selbourne</i>, Let. 15.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Frederick M. Middleton.</span></p>

  <p>As I can completely join in with the praise your correspondent <span
  class="sc">Mr. Tennyson</span> awards to Mr. Fennell's <i>Natural History
  of Quadrupeds</i> (except as regards some of its woodcuts, which I
  understand were inserted by the publisher in spite of the author's
  remonstrance), I feel induced to protect Mr. Fennell from the
  hypercritical commentary of your correspondent J.&nbsp;S.s. (p. 136.).</p>

  <p>In the passage quoted and commented on, had Mr. Fennell used the word
  <i>beach</i>, it would certainly have referred to the sea; but the word
  "shore," which he there uses, applies to rivers as well as seas. Thus
  Spenser, speaking of the river Nile, says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"... Beside the fruitful <i>shore</i> of muddy <i>Nile</i>,</p>
      <p>Upon a sunny bank outstretched lay,</p>
      <p>In monstrous length, a mighty crocodile."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The passage, therefore, in Mr. Fennell's work does not seem to me to
  be incorrect, as it may have reference to the <i>shore</i> of the Tweed,
  Ettrick, Yarrow, or some other rivers in Selkirkshire.</p>

  <p>May I take the present opportunity of inquiring through your truly
  useful columns, when Mr. Fennell's work on the natural history of
  Shakspeare, advertised some few years since, is likely to appear?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Archibald Fraser.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Woodford.</p>

  <p>"<i>Vanitatem observare</i>" (Vol. ix., pp. 247. 311.).&mdash;The
  quotation of R.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;G. is no more to be found in the Canons of Laodicea
  than in those of Ancyra. Indeed the passage has more the appearance of a
  recommendation, certainly excellent, than of any grave decree of a
  council. It can hardly be supposed to bear any other meaning than that
  Christian females ought not to <i>indulge vanity</i>, or take occasion to
  be vain of their works in wool, spun or woven; but to refer all their
  talent to the Almighty, who gives to them the skill and ability to work.
  Here is evidently an allusion to the skill and wisdom given to Beseleel
  and Ooliab:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Both of them hath he instructed with wisdom, to do ... tapestry and
  embroidery in blue and purple, <!-- Page 386 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page386"></a>{386}</span>and scarlet twice dyed, and fine linen,
  and to weave all things, and to invent all things."&mdash;Exod. xxxv.
  35.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And Christian women are reminded that all their skill in such work is
  the gift of God. The learned Benedictine Rupertus has a comment upon this
  passage of Exodus, so apposite that its substance may appropriately
  conclude this Note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Disce hinc, artes omnes, etiam mechanicas, esse dona Dei, saltem
  naturalia, neque in iis ut suis, suaque industria inventis aut partis,
  <i>homini gloriandum esse</i> (q. d. vanitatem observare), sed illas Deo
  adscribendas, ab eoque petendas, et in ejus obsequium expendendas
  esse."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">F. C. Husenbeth, D.D.</span></p>

  <p>The passage which your correspondent R.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;G. quotes from the Council
  of Ancyra, A.D. 314, is not to be found in the canons of that Council,
  which are printed in their original Greek, with several Latin
  translations, in Labbe's <i>Concilia</i>, vol. ii. p.&nbsp;513. The meaning of
  the sentence does not seem very abstruse; but before any suggestion is
  made for its interpretation, it will be desirable to ascertain to what
  Council it belongs.</p>

  <p><i>Divining Rod</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 350. 400.).&mdash;Your
  correspondents do not tell us what was discovered in the places to which
  the rod pointed in the hands of the ladies named; but although they
  cannot for a moment be suspected of wilfully deceiving, may there not
  have been, as in table-turning, an unconscious employment of muscular
  force? I have long since read, and have tried with success, the following
  mode of producing the effect:&mdash;Holding the rod in the usual
  position, one branch of the fork in each hand, and grasping them firmly,
  turn your hands slowly and steadily round inwards, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the right
  hand from the right to left, and the left from left to right&mdash;the
  point of the rod will then gradually descend till it points directly
  downwards.</p>

  <p><i>Orange Blossoms</i> (Vol. viii., p. 341.).&mdash;The compliment of
  Captain Absolute to Mrs. Malaprop in <i>The Rivals</i>, contains, I have
  no doubt, the allegorical reason of the employment of these flowers on
  bridal occasions; and in that view they seem highly appropriate, at least
  in our colder climates&mdash;where we often see many "flowers" still on
  the parent stem, while the "fruit" has attained its full perfection.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. S. Warden.</span></p>

  <p>"<i>Hip, hip, hurrah!</i>" (Vol. viii., pp. 88. 323.
  605.).&mdash;Allow me to correct two mistakes with reference to the notes
  on this subject. The note ascribed to Dr. Burney, in a copy of Hawkins's
  <i>History of Music</i>, in the British Museum, is in the handwriting of
  Sir John Hawkins, as are <i>all</i> the other notes scattered through the
  five volumes. These MS. notes have been included in the recent reprint of
  this valuable work. In the hurry of transcribing, Mr. Chappell (as your
  correspondent A.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;B. suggests) <i>misread</i> the MS. note. In future
  we must read "<i>hop</i> drinkers," and not "<i>hep</i> drinkers."</p>

  <p><i>Belgium Ecclesiastical Antiquities</i> (Vol. vii., p.

  Héraldique et Historique des Familles de Belgique</i>. This is the finest
  work on the antiquities, civil, military, and ecclesiastic, of that
  country: it was printed at Antwerp by Rapell fils, and is in five large
  4to. volumes. I saw a copy sold in Malines for about 3<i>l.</i>: it is

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The Faussett Collection has, as our readers are probably aware, become
  the property not of the public, but of a private individual, Mr. Joseph
  Mayer, F.S.A., of Liverpool, who, with praiseworthy liberality, has
  resolved to make the Collection as useful as possible to the public. He
  has therefore determined to publish, under the title of <i>Saxon
  Antiquities from the Kentish Tumuli</i>, Mr. Faussett's copious MS.
  accounts of the opening of the Barrows, and of the discoveries made in
  them; accompanied by numerous illustrations of the more important objects
  themselves, especially of the world-renowned Gold Brooches, which exhibit
  such exquisite specimens of the artistic skill of our ancestors. The work
  will appear under the editorship of Mr. C. Roach Smith, who will
  illustrate Mr. Faussett's discoveries by the results of kindred
  investigations in France and Germany. The subscription price is Two
  Guineas, and the number of copies will, as far as possible, be regulated
  by the list of subscribers.</p>

  <p>A few months since <i>The Athenæum</i> announced the discovery at
  Lambeth, some time previously, of a number of documents of the
  Cromwellian period. This announcement attracted the attention of some
  French literary man, probably M. Guizot, who appears to have made some
  inquiries on the subject, which resulted in a paragraph in the <i>Journal
  des Débats</i>, not, indeed, contradicting the fact of the discovery, but
  denying its importance. Can any of our readers throw light upon this
  matter? Had our valued correspondent <span class="sc">Dr. Maitland</span>
  still held office at Lambeth, there would probably not have been any
  doubt left as to the value or worthlessness of any MSS. discovered under
  the archiepiscopal roof,&mdash;albeit, found as we have understood these
  to have been, not in the department of the librarian, or, indeed, of any
  of the officials, but in some out-of-the way tower. Have these documents
  been examined? If so, what are they? If not, why does not the Society of
  Antiquaries send a deputation to the archbishop, and request his
  permission to undertake the task. Probably their labour would <!-- Page
  387 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page387"></a>{387}</span>not be
  thrown away. At all events, the doubt which now exists, whether valuable
  but unused materials for a most important period of our history may not
  be mouldering at Lambeth, would be removed; and future Carlyles be spared
  useless journeys and wasted hours to rediscover them.</p>

  <p>A publishing Society, somewhat similar to the Camden, has been
  established in the United States, under the title of <i>The Seventy-six
  Society</i>, for the publication and republication of books and papers
  relating to the American Revolution.</p>

  Description of that Stream, &amp;c.</i>, by George P.&nbsp;R. Pulman. A
  pleasant semi-piscatorial, semi-antiquarian, gossiping volume, welcome at
  this season, when the May-fly is looked for on the waters; illustrative
  of the fishing spots and historical localities of the far-famed
  Axe.&mdash;<i>Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered, translated into English
  Spenserian; with a Life of the Author</i>, by J.&nbsp;H. Wiffen, the new
  volume of Bohn's <i>Illustrated Library</i>, forms a fitting companion to
  Wright's <i>Dante</i>, so recently noticed by us.</p>
